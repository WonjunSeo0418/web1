  <h2>Marine corps</h2>
  <img src="Marine.png" width="350"><br>
  Marines or naval infantry, are typically a military force trained to operate on littoral zone in support
  of naval operations. At the beginning of its formation, tasks undertaken by marines have included helping
  maintain discipline and order aboard the ship (reflecting the pressed nature of the ships' company and the
   risk of mutiny), the boarding of vessels during combat or capture of prize ships, and providing manpower for
   raiding ashore in support of the naval objectives. In most countries, the marines are an integral part of that
   state's navy.

The exact term "marine" does not exist in many other languages. In French-speaking countries, two terms exist which
could be translated as "marine", but do not translate exactly: troupes de marine and fusiliers-marins; similar
pseudo-translations exist elsewhere, e.g. Fuzileiros Navais in Portuguese. The word marine means Navy in many
European languages such as French, German, Dutch and Norwegian.
